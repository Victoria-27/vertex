# Student Eligibility Report Form


This is a Next.js application for a Student Eligibility Report Form.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

``bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
